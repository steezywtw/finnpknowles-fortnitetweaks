  General Performance Tweaks (for Modern Consoles) 
Enable Performance Mode: On platforms like PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, this is a primary setting in the console's system settings (Settings > Save Data and Game/App Settings > Game Presets) that prioritizes frame rate over resolution, resulting in smoother gameplay.
Disable Motion Blur: This setting reduces input delay by minimizing visual artifacts, making your game feel more responsive.
Turn on Visual Sound Effects: For games like Fortnite, this feature helps in locating enemies by providing visual indicators of their sounds.
Utilize Visual Filters: Color blind settings or other visual filters can improve clarity in various conditions and help you spot opponents.
Turn Off Replays: Replays can put a strain on the console's performance and cause stutters, so turning them off can improve stability.
Game-Specific Tweaks 
Sensitivity Settings: Find a sensitivity that balances quick turns with precise aiming. This is highly personal, so you may need to experiment.
Hold to Swap/Auto Pickup: These settings can save time by allowing you to automatically swap weapons or pick up items by holding a button, rather than tapping it.
Reset on Release: For building and editing, this feature can lower input delay by resetting your edits or builds when you release a button.
What to Avoid on Console
PC Console Commands: Commands like fps_max 0, cl_forcepreload 1, or r_dynamic 0 are for PC versions of games and do not work on consoles. Console versions of games typically do not have a traditional "console" for players to enter commands directly.
